### Session Tracking

You can track the session both in a web app or a React Native app by using Analytics. A web session can be defined in different ways. To keep it simple we define a web session as being active when the page is not hidden and inactive when the page is hidden. A session in a React Native app is active when the app is in the foreground and inactive when the app is in the background.

For example:

<CH.Scrollycoding>

### Step 1

`enable` property (REQUIRED, turn on/off the auto tracking)

```js app.js focus=2
Analytics.autoTrack('session', {
  enable: true,
  attributes: {
    attr: 'attr',
  },
  provider: 'AWSPinpoint',
});
```

---

### Step 2

`attributes` property (OPTIONAL, the attributes of the event, you can either pass an object or a function which allows you to define dynamic attributes)

```js app.js focus=3:5

```

---

### Step 3

`provider` property (OPTIONAL, the service provider, by default is the Amazon Pinpoint)

```js app.js focus=6

```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

When the page is loaded, the Analytics module will send an event to the Amazon Pinpoint Service.

## Automatically track sessions

Analytics Auto Tracking helps you to automatically track user behaviors like sessions start/stop, page view change and web events like clicking or mouseover.

## Session Tracking

You can track the session both in a web app or a React Native app by using Analytics. A web session can be defined in different ways. To keep it simple we define a web session as being active when the page is not hidden and inactive when the page is hidden. A session in a React Native app is active when the app is in the foreground and inactive when the app is in the background.

For example:

<CH.Scrollycoding lineNumbers={true} showCopyButton={true}>

`enable` property (Required, turn on/off the auto tracking)

```js app.js mark=2
Analytics.autoTrack("session", {
  enable: true,
  attributes: {
    attr: "attr",
  },
  provider: "AWSPinpoint",
});
```

---

`attributes` property (Optional, the attributes of the event, you can either pass an object or a function which allows you to define dynamic attributes)

```js app.js mark=3:5

```

---

`provider` property (Optional, the service provider, by default is the Amazon Pinpoint)

```js app.js mark=6

```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

When the page is loaded, the Analytics module will send an event to the Amazon Pinpoint Service.

```
{
    eventType: '_session_start',
    attributes: {
        attr: 'attr'
    }
}

```

To keep backward compatibility, the auto tracking of the session is enabled by default. You can turn it off by:

```
Analytics.configure({
    // OPTIONAL - Allow recording session events. Default is true.
    autoSessionRecord: false,
});
```

or

```
Analytics.autoTrack('session', {
    enable: false
});

// Note: this must be called before Amplify.configure() or Analytics.configure() to cancel the session_start event

```
